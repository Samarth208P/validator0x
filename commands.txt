# Testing and Coverage Commands for validator0x

## Standard Testing
Run the entire test suite once:
```bash
npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode (useful during active development, only runs tests for changed files):
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

Run a specific test file:
```bash
npx jest tests/cardano.test.ts
```

Run a specific test case within a file (e.g., matching a description):
```bash
npx jest -t "should validate valid Solana address"
```

## Coverage Reports
Run the test suite and generate a detailed code coverage report:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```
This command will output a table in your terminal showing coverage for Statements, Branches, Functions, and Lines. 

**Note on viewing reports:** When you run the coverage command, Jest generates a `coverage/` directory (if configured, or outputs directly). You can often view an interactive HTML report by opening `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` in your browser.
